## how to

first go to this directory if not already for path resolving: `cd ai`

## Cluster data first

run `python cluster.py` to save clustered data into the `out_cluster` folder. So that things run faster when training

**Note: make sure to run the command when inside ai folder to resolve paths correctly**

## Train the network

run `python train_v0.py` to use previously clustered data to output trained models into `out_brain` folder
